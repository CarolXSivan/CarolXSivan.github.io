        <p>The financial performance analysis of Apple Inc.</p>
<p>In this assignment I am going to analyze the financial performance of Apple Inc., which consists of a SWOT analysis and an in-depth analysis. Investment recommendations will be made as well. Key calculations will be recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Pt.1 SWOT analysis</strong></p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>\1.   High brand popularity and reputation</p>
<p>\2.   Relatively high gross profit margin</p>
<p> (For instance, compared to Xiaomi in 2020, its gross margin was $104,956 million, while the gross margin of Xiaomi was $36,752 million.)</p>
<p>\3.   Mature and safe operating system</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>\1.   Low market share </p>
<p> (According to the <em>Personal computer (PC) shipments worldwide from 2013 to 2020, by vendor</em>, in 2020, Lenovo took accounts of 72.67 million, HP took up 67.65 million, while Apple accounted for 23.1 million)</p>
<p>\2.   The price of mobile phones is too high for average people to afford</p>
<p>\3.   Lack of innovation of latest released mobile phones</p>
<p> Opportunities:</p>
<p>\1.   Use China’s low-cost manufacturing to make up for the inefficiency of Apple’s own manufacturing department</p>
<p>\2.   The market of mobile phones is huge</p>
<p>\3.   There are a lot of suppliers of components, so that many choices are provided for Apple to minimize transaction cost.</p>
<p> Threats:</p>
<p>\1.   Strong competitors such as Dell and HP, whose products are averagely cheaper</p>
<p>\2.   Other competitive operating systems exist</p>
<p>  (According to the <em>Population of internet users worldwide from 2012 to 2019, by operating system</em>, in 2019, 1601.96 million of internet users chose Android, however, iOS users only accounted for 572.01 million.</p>
<p>  According to the <em>Market share held by the leading computer (desktop/tablet/console) operating systems worldwide from January 2012 to June 2021</em>, until June,2021, the market share of Windows was 68.54%, while that of MacOSX along with iOS was 17.49%)</p>
<p> <strong>Pt.2 In-depth analysis</strong></p>
<p>l Debt paying ability (uses data of the financial statements of Apple Inc. in 2020)</p>
<p>D/A ratio =258,549/323,888=79.8% (2020)</p>
<p>​     248,028/338,516=73.3% (2019)</p>
<p>The percentage has increased, which means the debt paying ability of Apple Inc. has become weaker in a long run.</p>
<p>Current ratio =154,106/132,507=1.16 (2020)</p>
<p>​      143,713/105,392=1.36 (2019)</p>
<p>The number has decreased and is smaller than 2, which means it is a bit unsafe for Apple Inc. to cover its debt.</p>
<p>l Leverage ratio =323,888/65,339=4.96 (2020)</p>
<p>​       338,516/90,488=3.74 (2019)</p>
<p>The quotient has increased, proving that Apple Inc. can leverage more asset.</p>
<p>l ROE =57,411/65,339=87.9% (2020)</p>
<p>   = (57,411/274,515) *(274,515/323,888) *(323,888/65,339) </p>
<p>   = 20.9% (net interest on sales) *84.8% (total asset turnover) *4.96(leverage ratio)</p>
<p>ROE = 55,256/90,488=61.1% (2019)</p>
<p>   = (55,256/260,174) *(260,174/338,516) *(338,516/90,488)</p>
<p>   = 21.2% *76.9% *3.74</p>
<p>From the data, we can see that the net interest on sales kept nearly constant, while the total asset turnover has risen based on a high percentage, which means the sales of Apple products is large. Besides, the leverage ratio has increased, suggesting that Apple Inc. has adjusted its balance sheet and increased its liability ratio. Thus, in a short run, the ROE of Apple Inc. has increased, so that equity investors may receive a higher return, but in a long run, the increasing percentage of liability will make the financial condition of Apple Inc. unstable.</p>
<p>l The P/E ratio of Apple Inc. is 28.85(ttm), while in the technical industry, the P/E ratio of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is 17.60(ttm) and 20.62 for Xiaomi, which means Apple Inc. has relatively high P/E ratio among the companies in the same field. Therefore, it implies that investors generally believe that the company’s earnings per share will grow rapidly in the future, so that the price-earnings ratio can be reduced to a reasonable level in a few years’ time. Once earnings growth is not as good as the assumption, the forces that underpin high price-to-earnings ratios are unsustainable and share prices tend to fall sharply.</p>
<p><strong>Pt.3 Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>As the information listed in the SWOT analysis, we can know that Apple Inc. is a well-known company with solid consumer loyalty, and the huge market of mobile phones as well as the broad choices of manufacturers make up the high gross profit of Apple products. However, it also reminds us of the risk that the price of Apple products is not so competitive as others, for example, HP laptops and Samsung mobile phones, resulting in its low market share.</p>
<p>For bond investors, since the D/A ratio of Apple Inc. is becoming larger, I doubt whether it is a good decision to lend large amount of money to Apple Inc, but considering about the relatively high ratio originally, the debt paying ability of Apple Inc. might be controllable.</p>
<p>Just three months ago, the COVID-19 epidemic sent Apple’s share price down 30 percent, from an all-time high of $325 to $224 in mid-February. The next rally convinced Apple fans that the company’s high share price was not unshakable due to force majeure from market momentum. Apple’s shares rose $62 to $362 between March 23 and June 20, breaking the previous record and increasing its market capitalization by $600bn, equivalent to the combined market capitalizations of Netflix, Tesla, and Adobe. The rally was the biggest in the history of global capitalism. It seems like Apple’s share price is growing too high, and some critics claim that it will be lucky for equity investors to receive single-digit rate of return in the next five years. Nevertheless, according to the data in pt.2, the ROE of Apple Inc. has increased, so that equity investors may receive a higher return. However, it is worth considering whether the P/E ratio could still rise along with the net sales.</p>
<p>From my point of view, I’m conservative about equity investors investing heavily in Apple stocks, and I would recommend banks to conduct precise stress tests during this special circumstance.</p>
