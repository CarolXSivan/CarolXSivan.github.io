        <p><strong>Standing at crossroads in life, graduation project help artist choose a path</strong> </p>
<p>“I experienced challenges from late 2019 to 2020,” said Bingshan, a 22-year-old female artist who was at final year of her four-year undergraduate program in Graphic Design at Nanjing University of Arts during that time. When graduation meets COVID-19 pandemic, “what I’m going to do” was a question popping into her mind when she underwent her graduation project and thought of her future. “The challenges truly helped me grow up in many ways and answer my question.”</p>
<p>As Bingshan started her final year in September 2019, doing a graduation project to achieve the degree and thinking about her future career became her major tasks. </p>
<p>“Graduation means I’m going to be kicked from peaceful campus to the society and severely beaten by it,” she wrote on her official Wechat.</p>
<p>The student was confused about career and future. Like some of her fellow students did, she took postgraduate entry exams and doubted if it was a right choice. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, she doubted if she should stick to her style of design while doing the project. </p>
<p>“Most of my fellow students follow a trend of using abstract and geometric design methods, such as modeling,” Bingshan said, “but I’m good at drawing illustrations.”</p>
<p>The student worried that illustrations aren’t trendy. “But my mentor suggested me to stick to my personal design style when I finally find it. At that time, I can use my own way to design graphics,” she said. </p>
<p>Since COVID-19 broke out in January last year, Bingshan’s university shut down and she was placed on lockdown for several months. The pandemic inspired the artist on the project topic. An idea called “Maslow’s hierarchy of needs” grabbed her attention, which illustrates the ascending five needs of human beings: physiological needs, safety needs, belongingness and love needs, esteem needs and self-actualization needs.</p>
<p>Bingshan realized the five basic needs were important to people during the pandemic. Based on them, she created five illustrations featuring the main character huddled in a small cubic room, which looks like a person who is placed on lockdown.</p>

<p>The theory also inspired her to think of her lifelong pursuits. She asked herself some questions for the very first time: “What kind of person I want to be? What kind of job I want to do?”</p>
<p>Although the answers are not clear, the artist has made decisions about near future — she decided to continue drawing illustrations.</p>
<p>Her graduation project was submitted and shortlisted in the 2020 Young Battle graduation season art competition. Meanwhile, She passed postgraduate entry exams and started her master’s degree in graphic design at Nanjing University of Arts in September 2020. In next three years, she is going to try her things and figure out more life questions. Meanwhile, she has joined Riso, a printing studio in November last year to publish some of her artworks, and is going to work there as a partnership after achieving her master’s degree.</p>
<p>“My expectation is to feed one skill (drawing illustrations) with another skill (making graphic designs),” said Bingshan. “That’s what my experience during COVID-19 pandemic has told me.” </p>
