<p>2020 FBLA business competition was the first competition that I have participated in since I entered school, which was an authoritative business competition.</p>
<p>Luckily, the first round didn’t require us to qualify a lot of business knowledge, and the official guide booklet was certainly enough for passing this round’s contest. What really mattered to me was how to arrange my self-study plan of the guide under the high pressure of my schoolwork. It is necessary to highlight the outline and key points of each session, for example, in the business ownership session, there were 4 kinds, where memorizing their functions were the most important, not the relevant examples given or lengthy definitions. In other words, the key to passing the first round was how to distribute your time to study the whole guide as well as define the real necessary knowledge.</p>
<p>Being shortlisted in the top 15% of my entry subject, Entrepreneurship, I soon found out that the national round was more academic, as the official guide became much thicker, and a case study was required to be presented by a group of 3. In addition, the preparation process truly taught me a lot of things, either academic or technical. I have learnt some basic method for analyzing a business case, for instance, SWOT and PEST, which practiced my ability to understand the properties of a business suggested behind sentences (Having some existing supporters or raw material providers mean that a partnership can be set. Selling marmalades implies that the PED graph of the product may be elastic.) Besides, conducting a case study in front of the judges using livestreaming meant that I needed to use proper facial expressions and gestures in order to make my presentation look natural, and quick response to the questions of the judges was vital. On the other hand, presenting a case study is certainly similar to a real-time experience of consulting with an investor or a shareholder. I should express my sincere using language and give professional advice together with strong evidence to them. Furthermore, as I have mentioned before, case study also examines the cooperation among teammates. It is more closed to a negotiation with colleagues, where communication skill and a sense of execution are extremely crucial, as we need to become familiar with each other and finish the preparation in a very limited time.</p>
<p>Last but not least, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the original schedule of taking part in the national competition in Shanghai was cancelled. Instead, we sat in our homes, doing case studies and completing multiple choices questions in front of a camera. Under this circumstance, honesty was also tested. Official guides were by our side; however, it was not ethical to malpractice secretly. After all, honesty is needed when being engaged in business activities in the real world.</p>
<p>My result of 2020 FBLA business competition was not bad, and four national certificates were received by myself ( Personal Finance national 15th place, Business Calculations national 5th place, Entrepreneurship national 25th place, Value Creators in Zone A). Looking forward to the offline competition next year.</p>
