        <p><strong>Young artist’s growth before &amp; during &amp; after the COVID-19 outbreak</strong></p>
<p>  “I’ve experienced challenges in late 2019 and 2020,” said Bing Shan, a young female artist who is currently a postgraduate studying graphic design in Nanjing University of the Arts. “But they truly helped me grow in many ways.”</p>
<p>  Bing Shan’s style of graphic design was undefined in the past. “Most people in my major follow the trend of using abstract and geometric designing method like creating models, but what I’m good at is drawing illustrations.” She asked her tutor about whether she should continue using illustrations to design, or simply follow the mainstream. “She said since I have such a personal style, I should stick to it. So that’s when my direction of graphic design formed.” To her, communication with peers is also very necessary. “ I used to find myself lack of inspiration. However, during a workshop I attended last year, I made friends with some excellent artists who shared the method of ‘create one work a day’, which is carrying a notebook with me to paint the ordinary things happening in daily life. I’ve been keeping this habit since then and it really offers me a lot more materials.”</p>
<p>  In the December of 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak broke out. By that time, Bing Shan was working at her graduation design for undergraduate. The epidemic forced her to use limited sources for graduation design. She searched on the Internet for up-to-date information and other artists’ works to continue her designing. “During that period, my output of paintings was large, which helped me decide the subject of my graduation design as well as posting them on social platforms and making physical products.” </p>
<p>  Her graduation design turned out to be in the context of a philosophy called “Hierarchical theory of needs”, which illustrates the ascending 5 needs of human beings. “The content of my graduation design made me think of my ultimate life-long persuit. After graduation, I ‘d like to continue drawing illustrations. On the other hand, I will use my professional knowledge and ability of graphic design to take over projects to maintain daily life.” She has joined a printing studio , Riso, in the November of 2020, and she is going to work there as a partner after graduation.</p>
<p>   “My expectation is to feed one skill (drawing illustrations) with another skill (making graphic designs),” said Bing Shan. “And that’s what my experience during COVID-19 outbreak has told me.”</p>
