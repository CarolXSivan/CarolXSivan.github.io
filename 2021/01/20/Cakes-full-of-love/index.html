        <p><strong>Cakes Full of Love</strong></p>
<p>‘Eat up these cakes and you’ll definitely get high marks!’ Mum said excitedly, wiping her hands with the apron.</p>
<p>Mum isn’t a woman who is good at expressing love to her daughter. A few weeks before Zhongkao, many mothers were planning to wear Qipao on the exam day. Mum didn’t think about this, because she knew that her body type wasn’t suitable for a Qipao. ‘Many mothers will support their kids in many ways, so what will you do for me?’ I once asked her. An embarrassed look appeared on her face. ‘ I’ll try.’</p>
<p>Magical things have happened since the following week. Mum bought some recipes home and insisted on learning to make one kind of cake every day. Mum leaves home at 7:30 a.m. and arrives at home from work at about 6:30 p.m. every day, but it seemed that she didn’t care much about her daily routine during that time. I often found her read the recipe carefully when I finished my homework at 11 p.m. every day.</p>
<p>I was very surprised at how serious Mum was when making the cakes. She used her finger to point at the words on the recipe in order that she wouldn’t miss any key process. What’s more, she made sure that she bought the best ingredients every time so that the quality of the cake could be proved.</p>
<p>Finally, it was the day before the exam day. Mum was making a kind of mysterious cake that she didn’t let anyone see her works, while I was busy reviewing my textbooks. In the whole house there was no noise or impatience. The atmosphere in the house was so harmonious that I felt completely relaxed.</p>
<p>The exam day was coming. As soon as I walked out from my bedroom, a kind of special aroma led me to the kitchen door. After a while, Mum walked to the dining room with a plate on her hand. The sweet smell was from here! I couldn’t wait to see what the mysterious thing was. It turned out to be some white cakes.‘They are called Dingsheng Gao,’ Mum said, ‘it means you will be successful after eating these cakes.’</p>
<p>What meaningful cakes! After biting the cake, I found the lovely filling in it-the osmanthus sauce. The fresh taste of the cake gave me a strong feeling: I am going to win with my mother’s love.</p>
<p>Making cakes was Mum’s own way to support me. The unique cakes truly gave me much confidence during the exams. At last, I really got high marks with Mum’s deep love.</p>
