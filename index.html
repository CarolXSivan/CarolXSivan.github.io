            <p>The Client Objective:<br>    The client Nichole Jordan has a total value of $100,000 for the investment portfolio, and with the expectations of us managing the assets are in order to achieve:<br>➢    $5,000 annually withdraws within the portfolio, for a minimum of 10 years.<br>➢    Contribute to their college tuition fee for 6 nieces and nephews<br>➢    Additional: Money for clients’ other financial goals, including retirement<br>Portfolio expectation:<br>    The minimum expectation of the growth of the portfolio, in order to meet the client objective.<br>➢    Under the circumstances all 6 nieces and nephews are all US citizens, $10,230 for state residents, and $26,290 for everyone else. An average of $35,830 at private non-profit colleges. With tuition tends to increase about 8% per year.<br>○    The possible expenditures are from the range of $61,380 to $214,980.<br>➢    The client would withdraw 5% of the original total value each year.<br>○    With total of at least $5,000 would be withdraw<br>Asset growth expectation:<br>    To meet the client’s expectation,  the portfolio would have to achieve a certain return annually.<br>➢    As mentioned, $5,000 would be withdrawn annually, this would need the portfolio to achieve 5% of annual growth.<br>➢    As the inflation of the asset, 1.5%<del>2.5% is expected annually, by at least breaking even with the inflation rate the annual growth would be expected to reach 3%, this allows the asset not to lose its value.<br>As in above, a 6.5%</del>7.5% of annual assets growth is a minimal requirement to sustain the client’s assets with its original value.<br>➢    In order to reach the highest possible expenditure of the total objective of $214,980. This would require:<br>○    7.95% of annual growth per year for 10 years<br>○    10.04% of annual growth per year for 8 years<br>○    13.61% of annual growth per year for 6 years<br>By taking the mean of between the years, 8 years would be set for our final goal. In addition to the total annual growth, 16%~18% of annual growth would be set. This expectation is reasonable due to the comparison to the annual growth of the main index funds.<br>Investitive environment:<br>In the investment portfolio, the asset allocation will be allocated with the goal of balancing between achieving the expectation and risk resistance capacity. The portfolio would be designed soundring the macro-environment that would have an impact in the whole financial market.<br>➢    Most of the business activities are recovering from the pandemic of Covid-19 with the increasing vaccination rate.<br>➢    Under President Biden’s presidency, a growing consensus that gradually tighter policy will be needed to keep inflation in check, leading the Federal Reserve System to increase the interest rate from currently 0.25%, with at least 1% by the end of 2023.<br>➢    GDP, employment rate, spending, and monetary and fiscal policy would be addressed for the portfolio.<br>Investment strategy:<br>    To achieve the expectation and to achieve the client’s objective. The portfolio are seeking to build around assets that suits the requirement:<br>➢    Determine the intrinsic value of an industry or a particular company, seeking for the under-price and high growth potential of the company or industry as a whole. By building a portfolio with high potential long term growth assets allowing long term growth in the total value of the total portfolio.<br>○    As the idea of sustainability has become one of the mainstreams, Nations around the world are getting in a trend of having growth in different areas sustainably.<br>➢    Balancing out the risk and return of the holding of different assets, as the client has a certain degree of risk tolerance. Constructing the portfolio base on the client’s risk tolerance would be in consider by<br>○    Diversifying the assets across several asset classes and industries. In addition to investing across asset classes, diversify by investing in multiple sub-categories within asset classes.<br>○    With the announcement of increase of the interest rate, and the whole labour market statistics imprecise due to the large amount of furlough throughout countries around the world. These investitive environments will affect the market in a certain way.<br>By building the client’s investment portfolio, the assets would be evaluated and be selected from the main idea of investing in companies that would have a huge growing potential while pairing up with selection of stocks that would meet the client’s expectation and meanwhile matching the client’s risk tolerance.<br>Mid-term Investment report<br>Risk hedging<br>    Throughout the constructing of the portfolio, a couple of fields and areas have been recognized. With further investigation and researches:<br>➢    The food and beverages field under the industry of consumer staples,  where the field  as a whole would bounce back and have a high growth potential throughout and after the post-pandemic era. In the portfolio, two of the companies that are oligopolies of the food and beverages market, which includes Coca-Cola Company(KO) and PepsiCo, Inc.(PEP).<br>○    These two companies are well known monopolists in the soft drink market, while these two companies are in together offering consumers with diversified beverage brands under their subsidiaries.<br>Due to the expectation of the whole beverage industry and the bright market prospects,  our team invested in both two oligopolies companies as a part of the portfolio. This allows both of the stock from a growing industry to act as a risk hedging role between one and another. When one company is losing the market shares within the beverage market, the other company would have relatively higher market shares, these would be shown throughout the stock market and the change in their financial statement. And finally the volatility of stock price from one company could be hedged by the other, while both of the companies would overall obtain a long term growth.<br>Stock Holding list (Up to date of 30/10/2021)<br>Symbol    Industry    Quantity    Symbol    Industry    Quantity    Symbol    Industry    Quantity<br>BX    Fiance    55    JNJ    Health Care    40    KO    Consumer Staples    75<br>AZN    Health Care    55    PEP    Consumer Staples    25    BAC    Fiance    125<br>CVX    Fiance    56    BLK    Fiance    6    ET    Energy    510</p>

            <p>The financial performance analysis of Apple Inc.</p>
<p>In this assignment I am going to analyze the financial performance of Apple Inc., which consists of a SWOT analysis and an in-depth analysis. Investment recommendations will be made as well. Key calculations will be recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Pt.1 SWOT analysis</strong></p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>\1.   High brand popularity and reputation</p>
<p>\2.   Relatively high gross profit margin</p>
<p> (For instance, compared to Xiaomi in 2020, its gross margin was $104,956 million, while the gross margin of Xiaomi was $36,752 million.)</p>
<p>\3.   Mature and safe operating system</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>\1.   Low market share </p>
<p> (According to the <em>Personal computer (PC) shipments worldwide from 2013 to 2020, by vendor</em>, in 2020, Lenovo took accounts of 72.67 million, HP took up 67.65 million, while Apple accounted for 23.1 million)</p>
<p>\2.   The price of mobile phones is too high for average people to afford</p>
<p>\3.   Lack of innovation of latest released mobile phones</p>
<p> Opportunities:</p>
<p>\1.   Use China’s low-cost manufacturing to make up for the inefficiency of Apple’s own manufacturing department</p>
<p>\2.   The market of mobile phones is huge</p>
<p>\3.   There are a lot of suppliers of components, so that many choices are provided for Apple to minimize transaction cost.</p>
<p> Threats:</p>
<p>\1.   Strong competitors such as Dell and HP, whose products are averagely cheaper</p>
<p>\2.   Other competitive operating systems exist</p>
<p>  (According to the <em>Population of internet users worldwide from 2012 to 2019, by operating system</em>, in 2019, 1601.96 million of internet users chose Android, however, iOS users only accounted for 572.01 million.</p>
<p>  According to the <em>Market share held by the leading computer (desktop/tablet/console) operating systems worldwide from January 2012 to June 2021</em>, until June,2021, the market share of Windows was 68.54%, while that of MacOSX along with iOS was 17.49%)</p>
<p> <strong>Pt.2 In-depth analysis</strong></p>
<p>l Debt paying ability (uses data of the financial statements of Apple Inc. in 2020)</p>
<p>D/A ratio =258,549/323,888=79.8% (2020)</p>
<p>​     248,028/338,516=73.3% (2019)</p>
<p>The percentage has increased, which means the debt paying ability of Apple Inc. has become weaker in a long run.</p>
<p>Current ratio =154,106/132,507=1.16 (2020)</p>
<p>​      143,713/105,392=1.36 (2019)</p>
<p>The number has decreased and is smaller than 2, which means it is a bit unsafe for Apple Inc. to cover its debt.</p>
<p>l Leverage ratio =323,888/65,339=4.96 (2020)</p>
<p>​       338,516/90,488=3.74 (2019)</p>
<p>The quotient has increased, proving that Apple Inc. can leverage more asset.</p>
<p>l ROE =57,411/65,339=87.9% (2020)</p>
<p>   = (57,411/274,515) *(274,515/323,888) *(323,888/65,339) </p>
<p>   = 20.9% (net interest on sales) *84.8% (total asset turnover) *4.96(leverage ratio)</p>
<p>ROE = 55,256/90,488=61.1% (2019)</p>
<p>   = (55,256/260,174) *(260,174/338,516) *(338,516/90,488)</p>
<p>   = 21.2% *76.9% *3.74</p>
<p>From the data, we can see that the net interest on sales kept nearly constant, while the total asset turnover has risen based on a high percentage, which means the sales of Apple products is large. Besides, the leverage ratio has increased, suggesting that Apple Inc. has adjusted its balance sheet and increased its liability ratio. Thus, in a short run, the ROE of Apple Inc. has increased, so that equity investors may receive a higher return, but in a long run, the increasing percentage of liability will make the financial condition of Apple Inc. unstable.</p>
<p>l The P/E ratio of Apple Inc. is 28.85(ttm), while in the technical industry, the P/E ratio of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is 17.60(ttm) and 20.62 for Xiaomi, which means Apple Inc. has relatively high P/E ratio among the companies in the same field. Therefore, it implies that investors generally believe that the company’s earnings per share will grow rapidly in the future, so that the price-earnings ratio can be reduced to a reasonable level in a few years’ time. Once earnings growth is not as good as the assumption, the forces that underpin high price-to-earnings ratios are unsustainable and share prices tend to fall sharply.</p>
<p><strong>Pt.3 Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>As the information listed in the SWOT analysis, we can know that Apple Inc. is a well-known company with solid consumer loyalty, and the huge market of mobile phones as well as the broad choices of manufacturers make up the high gross profit of Apple products. However, it also reminds us of the risk that the price of Apple products is not so competitive as others, for example, HP laptops and Samsung mobile phones, resulting in its low market share.</p>
<p>For bond investors, since the D/A ratio of Apple Inc. is becoming larger, I doubt whether it is a good decision to lend large amount of money to Apple Inc, but considering about the relatively high ratio originally, the debt paying ability of Apple Inc. might be controllable.</p>
<p>Just three months ago, the COVID-19 epidemic sent Apple’s share price down 30 percent, from an all-time high of $325 to $224 in mid-February. The next rally convinced Apple fans that the company’s high share price was not unshakable due to force majeure from market momentum. Apple’s shares rose $62 to $362 between March 23 and June 20, breaking the previous record and increasing its market capitalization by $600bn, equivalent to the combined market capitalizations of Netflix, Tesla, and Adobe. The rally was the biggest in the history of global capitalism. It seems like Apple’s share price is growing too high, and some critics claim that it will be lucky for equity investors to receive single-digit rate of return in the next five years. Nevertheless, according to the data in pt.2, the ROE of Apple Inc. has increased, so that equity investors may receive a higher return. However, it is worth considering whether the P/E ratio could still rise along with the net sales.</p>
<p>From my point of view, I’m conservative about equity investors investing heavily in Apple stocks, and I would recommend banks to conduct precise stress tests during this special circumstance.</p>

            <p>Describe an accomplishment, event, or realization that sparked a period of personal growth and a new understanding of yourself or others. (Maximum 350 words)</p>
<p>I have been thinking about establishing my own pop-culture and entertainment company since Grade 10. However, I often doubt whether this idea is mature enough due to my limited knowledge of entrepreneurship and leadership ability.</p>
<p>Last week I took part in the Emerging Leaders Summit held by FBLA China, focusing on conducting leadership training through a range of activities. </p>
<p>The case study on the second day truly gave me a new understanding of myself and my teammates. The reading material was a brief introduction of how the sport brand Under Armor was established. I concluded from the text that Kevin Plank, the founder of Under Armor, used a kind of leadership strategy called ‘servant leadership’, which prioritized consumer satisfaction and loyalty. In addition, his leadership traits such as caring and innovation also sparked my thoughts. Since I want to design my own clothes brand, the process of discovering suitable fabrics is vital in order to be high-quality and differentiate from other brands. This piece of thought was inspired by the story that Kevin Plank designed the first rugby shirts with quick-drying technique, which saved the uncomfortableness of sweating. From this event, I noticed that myself actually had some thoughts of how to set up a qualified business in details.</p>
<p>Apart from this, during the presentation time, the confidence of the speakers taught me a valuable lesson. Appropriate body languages as well as infectious emotion were used, and every group worked out an outline of their presentation using laptops efficiently. Seeing other students’ mature performance, I realized that we all have developed some potential leadership traits for future.</p>
<p>After taking part in the summit, I believe that I already have some ideas for my future business, and there are plenty of merit future business leaders around me.</p>

            <p>Knowing yourself well</p>
<p>required</p>
<p>Good leaders know themselves well. They have the ability to analyze their own strengths and weaknesses, set personal and vocational goals, and have the self-esteem, confidence, motivation, and abilities to carry them out.</p>
<p>​                                          My strengths in analyzing and conducting data</p>
<p> In regard of the most unique character of myself, it reminds me of my ability of analyzing and conducting data. Recently I have done an online career analysis called Morrisby, which illustrated that I owned a high percentage of numerical ability as well as an analyzing interest.</p>
<p> Apart from using scientific testing to prove my ability, I develop such kind of character through various ways. Last term, our Economics teacher organized a project named ‘Student Company’, requiring us to set up our own company and sell original products on the School Food Festival. I worked as Analytical Manager of my team’s company due to my efficiency in integrating and analyzing figures. My first task was to design a questionnaire to investigate what kind of creative products students would like to purchase. I asked 3 specific questions and gave out both paper and online questionnaires. Afterwards, I built pie charts and bar charts so that information could be summarized. According to my analysis, bookmarks together with badges were the products that most students looked forward to. In addition, the data lead me to the conclusion that adopting retailing was the most suitable method. My assumption turned out to be accurate in the end, which brought our company appreciable profits.</p>
<p> Moreover, I made a financial statement for our market sales. I read relative books such as Principles of Economics and studied the 2020 financial statement of Apple Company in order that I understood the basic format and professional terms of a financial statement. Besides, I divided the available data into groups to calculate separately, so that no false calculations were made. </p>
<p> To sum up, because I am a care person and are sensitive to figures, my numerical ability is relatively high. To help myself strengthen this character, I have learnt how to collect and build models to analyze data effectively.                   </p>

            <p>Relationship Building</p>
<p>required</p>
<p>Leaders understand the value of building long-lasting relationships with people in their industry and make a point to pursue partnerships whenever they can. Building a network of valuable people is critical for your long-term success.</p>
<p>​                                                      Establishing my own social circle</p>
<p> Early in junior high, I have defined my dream as setting up my own pop culture company, which requires me to acquire knowledge in Business and Entrepreneurship, s well as build relationships with people who do well in designing and computer programming, as I might not apply for courses in these fields in college.</p>
<p> Building a relationship should never be a deliberate action. From my point of view, after I get to know a person’s strengths and find them can fill in my shortcomings, I will share my opinions with him or her honestly, then ask whether he or she is interested in supporting my future goal. In addition, exchanging ideas is the key to establishing a long-lasting relationship. For instance, one of my friends hopes to start her own entertainment company in the future, while I am eager to enter the pop culture industry as mentioned before. It is clear that we both want to become entrepreneurs, so that exchanging our resources is very valuable. During school breaks as well as weekends, we would like to brainstorm about our future industries, which helps us developing our plans more specifically and considering about cross-field cooperation.</p>
<p> Moreover, I highly value relationships with adults. Due to their age difference, they usually own more abundant resources and wider networks, making it essential to ask for advice from them. Take myself as an example, I make friends with a tour guide who works in European countries. Keeping in touch with her can provide me with timely information of the fashion trends in Western nations. I have summarize some useful methods of socializing with your elders. First of all, always be modest and listen to their experiences carefully. Secondly, ask them questions frequently to extend this relationship. Apart from those, I find that chatting with adults about our common interests or hobbies can quickly diminish the age barrier between ourselves.</p>
<p> From my perspective, building a relationship should not be deliberate. However, it is vital to keep in touch regularly and exchange our creative ideas in order that valuable friends or helpers will not be missed.</p>

            <p>First time to be a future business leader</p>
<p>2020 FBLA business competition was the first competition that I have participated in since I entered school, which was an authoritative business competition.</p>
<p>Luckily, the first round didn’t require us to qualify a lot of business knowledge, and the official guide booklet was certainly enough for passing this round’s contest. What really mattered to me was how to arrange my self-study plan of the guide under the high pressure of my schoolwork. It is necessary to highlight the outline and key points of each session, for example, in the business ownership session, there were 4 kinds, where memorizing their functions were the most important, not the relevant examples given or lengthy definitions. In other words, the key to passing the first round was how to distribute your time to study the whole guide as well as define the real necessary knowledge.</p>
<p>Being shortlisted in the top 15% of my entry subject, Entrepreneurship, I soon found out that the national round was more academic, as the official guide became much thicker, and a case study was required to be presented by a group of 3. In addition, the preparation process truly taught me a lot of things, either academic or technical. I have learnt some basic method for analyzing a business case, for instance, SWOT and PEST, which practiced my ability to understand the properties of a business suggested behind sentences (Having some existing supporters or raw material providers mean that a partnership can be set. Selling marmalades implies that the PED graph of the product may be elastic.) Besides, conducting a case study in front of the judges using livestreaming meant that I needed to use proper facial expressions and gestures in order to make my presentation look natural, and quick response to the questions of the judges was vital. On the other hand, presenting a case study is certainly similar to a real-time experience of consulting with an investor or a shareholder. I should express my sincere using language and give professional advice together with strong evidence to them. Furthermore, as I have mentioned before, case study also examines the cooperation among teammates. It is more closed to a negotiation with colleagues, where communication skill and a sense of execution are extremely crucial, as we need to become familiar with each other and finish the preparation in a very limited time.</p>
<p>Last but not least, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the original schedule of taking part in the national competition in Shanghai was cancelled. Instead, we sat in our homes, doing case studies and completing multiple choices questions in front of a camera. Under this circumstance, honesty was also tested. Official guides were by our side; however, it was not ethical to malpractice secretly. After all, honesty is needed when being engaged in business activities in the real world.</p>
<p>My result of 2020 FBLA business competition was not bad, and four national certificates were received by myself ( Personal Finance national 15th place, Business Calculations national 5th place, Entrepreneurship national 25th place, Value Creators in Zone A). Looking forward to the offline competition next year.</p>

            <p>Briefly describe a personal goal you have set for yourself, and how long you have been working to achieve this goal. Who did you turn to for advice or help, and what was their role? what did you learn about yourself? (maximum 350 words)</p>
<p> Because Business Management or Economics will be my first choice for my university course application, the relevant grades in my Economics course are very important. I have set myself a goal for the final IGCSE exam of Economics, which is to achieve an A*. Although I had not been exposed to Economics before high school, I soon find that it is closely related to my ideal profession and I am strongly interested in it.</p>
<p> I put my effort in Economics as much as possible since I entered Grade 10. There are plenty of basic principles and academic terms that I am unfamiliar with, reducing my efficiency of understanding the textbook. As a result, I turned to some books for help, which illustrated the key terms in both micro and macro economics very precisely and offered me a quick access to fill my knowledge gap.</p>
<p> In addition, I have asked my economics teacher as well as my classmates who are good at Economics for help. They act as my mistake correctors and instructors. As some specific formats and exam strategies are tested in Economics exams, it is essential for me to ask my teacher to help me correct the nonstandard formats I have written. Therefore, my accuracy in tests has been significantly improved. Besides, learning from peers is certainly a good method. My classmates recommended some of their tips for studying Economics to me, which I found very useful and have added to my skill set.</p>
<p> During the process of pursuing an A* of Economics, I learnt that the two words-“precise” and “modest” are the keys to achieve my personal goal. A keen sense of judgement to economic cases is highly required, and that is what I should learn from others continuously.</p>

            <p><strong>Standing at crossroads in life, graduation project help artist choose a path</strong> </p>
<p>“I experienced challenges from late 2019 to 2020,” said Bingshan, a 22-year-old female artist who was at final year of her four-year undergraduate program in Graphic Design at Nanjing University of Arts during that time. When graduation meets COVID-19 pandemic, “what I’m going to do” was a question popping into her mind when she underwent her graduation project and thought of her future. “The challenges truly helped me grow up in many ways and answer my question.”</p>
<p>As Bingshan started her final year in September 2019, doing a graduation project to achieve the degree and thinking about her future career became her major tasks. </p>
<p>“Graduation means I’m going to be kicked from peaceful campus to the society and severely beaten by it,” she wrote on her official Wechat.</p>
<p>The student was confused about career and future. Like some of her fellow students did, she took postgraduate entry exams and doubted if it was a right choice. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, she doubted if she should stick to her style of design while doing the project. </p>
<p>“Most of my fellow students follow a trend of using abstract and geometric design methods, such as modeling,” Bingshan said, “but I’m good at drawing illustrations.”</p>
<p>The student worried that illustrations aren’t trendy. “But my mentor suggested me to stick to my personal design style when I finally find it. At that time, I can use my own way to design graphics,” she said. </p>
<p>Since COVID-19 broke out in January last year, Bingshan’s university shut down and she was placed on lockdown for several months. The pandemic inspired the artist on the project topic. An idea called “Maslow’s hierarchy of needs” grabbed her attention, which illustrates the ascending five needs of human beings: physiological needs, safety needs, belongingness and love needs, esteem needs and self-actualization needs.</p>
<p>Bingshan realized the five basic needs were important to people during the pandemic. Based on them, she created five illustrations featuring the main character huddled in a small cubic room, which looks like a person who is placed on lockdown.</p>

<p>The theory also inspired her to think of her lifelong pursuits. She asked herself some questions for the very first time: “What kind of person I want to be? What kind of job I want to do?”</p>
<p>Although the answers are not clear, the artist has made decisions about near future — she decided to continue drawing illustrations.</p>
<p>Her graduation project was submitted and shortlisted in the 2020 Young Battle graduation season art competition. Meanwhile, She passed postgraduate entry exams and started her master’s degree in graphic design at Nanjing University of Arts in September 2020. In next three years, she is going to try her things and figure out more life questions. Meanwhile, she has joined Riso, a printing studio in November last year to publish some of her artworks, and is going to work there as a partnership after achieving her master’s degree.</p>
<p>“My expectation is to feed one skill (drawing illustrations) with another skill (making graphic designs),” said Bingshan. “That’s what my experience during COVID-19 pandemic has told me.” </p>

<h1 id="Case-study-part-2（bulletpoint-1-3"><a href="#Case-study-part-2（bulletpoint-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Case study part 2（bulletpoint 1,3)"></a>Case study part 2（bulletpoint 1,3)</h1><p>Next we move on to decide what kind of business ownership should Lacey have.</p>
<p>We advise Lacey and her business partners set the ownership of partnership or LLC .</p>
<p>A partnership is a business owned by two or more people . Many entrepreneurs prefer to go into business with one or more partners so that they can share decision-making and management responsibilities as well as the risks involved with entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>For the advantages of a partnership, first ,it means you will not to come up with all of the capital alone.For example, Lacey can ask her partner who does farming to provide machines to manufacture oranges . Moreover , any losses the business incurs will be shared by all of the partners , and they can offer Lancey expertise and knowledge in different fields .</p>
<p>However , some partners may not want to share responsibilities and profits with others ,so the partnership may result in disagreements and end bitterly .</p>
<p>On the other hand , Lacey can also choose to set up a limited liability company (Short for LLC ).</p>
<p>A limited liability company is a legal form of business that provides the benefits of a partnership taxation and limited liability features of a corporation for all of the business . Owners of LLCs are known as members .</p>
<p>Here are some advantages of LLCs . First of all , it limits liability for managers and members, which means every member ‘s responsibility is clearly defined ,so they wouldn’t fear being held legally liable for the errors of their partners . Another advantage is an LLC has flow-through taxation. Profits are distributed to the members , who are taxed on profits at their personal tax level, which avoids double taxation .</p>
<p>Nevertheless , an LLC has some disadvantages . For instance, some states ,including California ,charge extra fees for opening an LLC .</p>
<p>If Lacey wants to run a short-term business , we prefer to let her choose the partnership , because a partnership faces little government regulation and is relatively easy to be organised . However ,if she wants a long-term business ,it’s better to set an LLC, as there are clear liability limitations and good privacy protection ,which can ensure the life expectancy of Lancey’s business .</p>
<p>For the following part , I will introduce the industry characteristic, major competitors ,market segment as well as the price strategy of Lacey’s Marmalades and Jellies.</p>
<p>Lacey’s Marmalades and Jellies has a relatively elastic price elasticity of demand and supply.</p>
<p><img src="C:\Users\xubin\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210206173738475.png" alt="image-20210206173738475"></p>
<p>Because marmalades and jellies are a kind of necessity and have lots of substitutes ,a rise in the price of them would be likely to cause a greater percentage contraction in demand .</p>
<p><img src="C:\Users\xubin\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210206173804341.png" alt="image-20210206173804341"></p>
<p>Because marmalades and jellies can be produced quickly and can be stored for a relatively long time ,they have an elastic PES ,which means a change in price causes a greater change in the quantity supplied .</p>
<p>The major competitors of Lacey’s business are producers who also produce marmalades and Jellies ,because they have entered the market for longer time with better reputation ,and their products are close substitutes of Lacey’s products .</p>
<p>Lacey’s marmalades and Jellies should belong to mass market . It aims to address the highest number of potential customers while ignoring niche demographic differences .The strategy involved in this type of marketing strategy focuses on a higher volume of sales at lower prices so as to obtain maximum exposure for the product. Through this market strategy , Lacey can sell her products at a moderate price to the general public .</p>
<p>For the price strategy , Lacey can take penetration pricing , which is a pricing strategy of setting a relatively low price often supported by strong promotion in order to achieve a high volume of sales . Lacey should use this kind of strategy ,because she is attempting to use mass marketing and gain a large market share . The price could be slowly increased as she knows the market better .</p>
<p>Here is a strategic analysis of Lacey’s business . We use a SWOT analysis .</p>
<p><img src="C:\Users\xubin\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210206173831244.png" alt="image-20210206173831244"></p>
<p>That’s all for my part , thank you .</p>
