        <p><strong>Standing at crossroads in life, graduation project help artist choose a path</strong> </p>
<p>“I experienced challenges from late 2019 to 2020,” said Bingshan, a 22-year-old female artist who was at final year of her four-year undergraduate program in Graphic Design at Nanjing University of Arts during that time. When graduation meets COVID-19 pandemic, “what I’m going to do” was a question popping into her mind when she underwent her graduation project and thought of her future. “The challenges truly helped me grow up in many ways and answer my question.”</p>
<p>As Bingshan started her final year in September 2019, doing a graduation project to achieve the degree and thinking about her future career became her major tasks. </p>
<p>“Graduation means I’m going to be kicked from peaceful campus to the society and severely beaten by it,” she wrote on her official Wechat.</p>
<p>The student was confused about career and future. Like some of her fellow students did, she took postgraduate entry exams and doubted if it was a right choice. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, she doubted if she should stick to her style of design while doing the project. </p>
<p>“Most of my fellow students follow a trend of using abstract and geometric design methods, such as modeling,” Bingshan said, “but I’m good at drawing illustrations.”</p>
<p>The student worried that illustrations aren’t trendy. “But my mentor suggested me to stick to my personal design style when I finally find it. At that time, I can use my own way to design graphics,” she said. </p>
<p>Since COVID-19 broke out in January last year, Bingshan’s university shut down and she was placed on lockdown for several months. The pandemic inspired the artist on the project topic. An idea called “Maslow’s hierarchy of needs” grabbed her attention, which illustrates the ascending five needs of human beings: physiological needs, safety needs, belongingness and love needs, esteem needs and self-actualization needs.</p>
<p>Bingshan realized the five basic needs were important to people during the pandemic. Based on them, she created five illustrations featuring the main character huddled in a small cubic room, which looks like a person who is placed on lockdown.</p>

<p>The theory also inspired her to think of her lifelong pursuits. She asked herself some questions for the very first time: “What kind of person I want to be? What kind of job I want to do?”</p>
<p>Although the answers are not clear, the artist has made decisions about near future — she decided to continue drawing illustrations.</p>
<p>Her graduation project was submitted and shortlisted in the 2020 Young Battle graduation season art competition. Meanwhile, She passed postgraduate entry exams and started her master’s degree in graphic design at Nanjing University of Arts in September 2020. In next three years, she is going to try her things and figure out more life questions. Meanwhile, she has joined Riso, a printing studio in November last year to publish some of her artworks, and is going to work there as a partnership after achieving her master’s degree.</p>
<p>“My expectation is to feed one skill (drawing illustrations) with another skill (making graphic designs),” said Bingshan. “That’s what my experience during COVID-19 pandemic has told me.” </p>

<p><img src="C:\Users\xubin\Desktop\2021-02-06_172631.jpg"></p>
<h1 id="Case-study-part-2（bulletpoint-1-3"><a href="#Case-study-part-2（bulletpoint-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Case study part 2（bulletpoint 1,3)"></a>Case study part 2（bulletpoint 1,3)</h1><p>Next we move on to decide what kind of business ownership should Lacey have.</p>
<p>We advise Lacey and her business partners set the ownership of partnership or LLC .</p>
<p>A partnership is a business owned by two or more people . Many entrepreneurs prefer to go into business with one or more partners so that they can share decision-making and management responsibilities as well as the risks involved with entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>For the advantages of a partnership, first ,it means you will not to come up with all of the capital alone.For example, Lacey can ask her partner who does farming to provide machines to manufacture oranges . Moreover , any losses the business incurs will be shared by all of the partners , and they can offer Lancey expertise and knowledge in different fields .</p>
<p>However , some partners may not want to share responsibilities and profits with others ,so the partnership may result in disagreements and end bitterly .</p>
<p>On the other hand , Lacey can also choose to set up a limited liability company (Short for LLC ).</p>
<p>A limited liability company is a legal form of business that provides the benefits of a partnership taxation and limited liability features of a corporation for all of the business . Owners of LLCs are known as members .</p>
<p>Here are some advantages of LLCs . First of all , it limits liability for managers and members, which means every member ‘s responsibility is clearly defined ,so they wouldn’t fear being held legally liable for the errors of their partners . Another advantage is an LLC has flow-through taxation. Profits are distributed to the members , who are taxed on profits at their personal tax level, which avoids double taxation .</p>
<p>Nevertheless , an LLC has some disadvantages . For instance, some states ,including California ,charge extra fees for opening an LLC .</p>
<p>If Lacey wants to run a short-term business , we prefer to let her choose the partnership , because a partnership faces little government regulation and is relatively easy to be organised . However ,if she wants a long-term business ,it’s better to set an LLC, as there are clear liability limitations and good privacy protection ,which can ensure the life expectancy of Lancey’s business .</p>
<p>For the following part , I will introduce the industry characteristic, major competitors ,market segment as well as the price strategy of Lacey’s Marmalades and Jellies.</p>
<p>Lacey’s Marmalades and Jellies has a relatively elastic price elasticity of demand and supply.</p>
<p><img src="C:\Users\xubin\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210206173738475.png" alt="image-20210206173738475"></p>
<p>Because marmalades and jellies are a kind of necessity and have lots of substitutes ,a rise in the price of them would be likely to cause a greater percentage contraction in demand .</p>
<p><img src="C:\Users\xubin\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210206173804341.png" alt="image-20210206173804341"></p>
<p>Because marmalades and jellies can be produced quickly and can be stored for a relatively long time ,they have an elastic PES ,which means a change in price causes a greater change in the quantity supplied .</p>
<p>The major competitors of Lacey’s business are producers who also produce marmalades and Jellies ,because they have entered the market for longer time with better reputation ,and their products are close substitutes of Lacey’s products .</p>
<p>Lacey’s marmalades and Jellies should belong to mass market . It aims to address the highest number of potential customers while ignoring niche demographic differences .The strategy involved in this type of marketing strategy focuses on a higher volume of sales at lower prices so as to obtain maximum exposure for the product. Through this market strategy , Lacey can sell her products at a moderate price to the general public .</p>
<p>For the price strategy , Lacey can take penetration pricing , which is a pricing strategy of setting a relatively low price often supported by strong promotion in order to achieve a high volume of sales . Lacey should use this kind of strategy ,because she is attempting to use mass marketing and gain a large market share . The price could be slowly increased as she knows the market better .</p>
<p>Here is a strategic analysis of Lacey’s business . We use a SWOT analysis .</p>
<p><img src="C:\Users\xubin\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20210206173831244.png" alt="image-20210206173831244"></p>
<p>That’s all for my part , thank you .</p>

        <p>   I read Lesson 1.1 and 1.2 of the first chapter, <em>Classification</em> today.</p>
<p>   I have learned  that living organisms have 7 features or characteristics which make them different from objects that are not alive. These characteristics are <strong>growth, movement, sensitivity, excretion, reproduction, nutrition and respiration</strong>. </p>
<p>   Here are the definitions of these words.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\xubin\Desktop\微信图片_20210204203421.jpg"  />

<p>   In addition to these 7 definitions, living organisms have another feature in common- they are all made of <strong>cells</strong>, which all have <strong>cytoplasm, a cell membrane, DNA, ribosomes and enzymes</strong>.</p>
<p>   Besides,  I have known how to classify living things.</p>
<p>   The first method is to <strong>use DNA to help with classification</strong>. Biologists can compare the sequences of bases(which are called A,C,G and T) in the DNA of organisms from two different species. The more similar the base sequences, the more closely related the species are to one another.</p>
<p>  The second method is to <strong>use the classification system</strong>, introduced by <em>Swedish naturalist Linnaeus</em> in 1735. He divided all the different kinds of living things into groups called species. The organisms belong to the same species if they can breed together successfully, and their offspring can also breed. </p>
<p>  The complete order is like this: <strong>Species &lt; Genus &lt; Family &lt; Order &lt; Class &lt; Phylum &lt; Kingdom</strong>.</p>

    </h1>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p><strong>Should Art courses be included in the scope of Zhongkao?</strong></p>
<p>As it is known to all, Music and Art have always been two compulsory courses for middle school students in China. However, the attitudes of different cities towards the question of whether Art courses should be included in the scope of Zhongkao are not the same. Is it wise to put Music and Art into the scope that must be examined?</p>
<p>In some cities, for example, Guilin and Yiyang, Art courses end before Zhongkao and they needn’t be examined. This regulation has a clear advantage that students aren’t distracted by the preparation of Art exam so that they can focus more on other subjects. </p>
<p>However, every coin has two sides. Music and Art don’t need to be examined, which means they aren’t as important as other subjects in some ways. Because of this, some students don’t concentrate on their Art courses and even ignore them. Therefore, they will be lack of the knowledge of arts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many cities such as Shanghai and Shijiazhuang, consider Music and Art as subjects of examination. Students there must prepare for Music and Art exams, which means they are asked to recite all kinds of related knowledge points. During the process, students can improve their memories and aesthetic levels step by step.</p>
<p>It is, however, arguable that whether adopting this kind of method can really make students learn more deeply about Music and Art. Some critics state that this method can only force students to recite dull knowledge, and turn the learning process into a kind of formalism. What’s more, a lot of parents are worried that preparing for Art exams take up too much valuable time of the ninth grade. Music and Art are seemed as burdens to some students.</p>
<p>I am a graduate from a junior high in Nanjing where Music and Art must be examined. When it comes to me, putting Music and Art into the scope of Zhongkao isn’t a wise action. For us who were preparing for Zhongkao, the exams of Music and Art were like two tricky tasks. We focused on reciting the sentences required to be remembered, but ignored the real charm of these subjects. In other words, we didn’t have time to do further learning or seek the interesting side of Music and Art. The original intension of the Ministry of Education has not been realized at all.</p>
<p>In summary, it is not sensible to put Music and Art into the scope of Zhongkao. Forcing students to feel the charm of Music and Art is counterproductive. After all, we need to be willing to develop our aesthetic abilities on our own instead of being stuck in a school syllabus.</p>

        <p><strong>Cakes Full of Love</strong></p>
<p>‘Eat up these cakes and you’ll definitely get high marks!’ Mum said excitedly, wiping her hands with the apron.</p>
<p>Mum isn’t a woman who is good at expressing love to her daughter. A few weeks before Zhongkao, many mothers were planning to wear Qipao on the exam day. Mum didn’t think about this, because she knew that her body type wasn’t suitable for a Qipao. ‘Many mothers will support their kids in many ways, so what will you do for me?’ I once asked her. An embarrassed look appeared on her face. ‘ I’ll try.’</p>
<p>Magical things have happened since the following week. Mum bought some recipes home and insisted on learning to make one kind of cake every day. Mum leaves home at 7:30 a.m. and arrives at home from work at about 6:30 p.m. every day, but it seemed that she didn’t care much about her daily routine during that time. I often found her read the recipe carefully when I finished my homework at 11 p.m. every day.</p>
<p>I was very surprised at how serious Mum was when making the cakes. She used her finger to point at the words on the recipe in order that she wouldn’t miss any key process. What’s more, she made sure that she bought the best ingredients every time so that the quality of the cake could be proved.</p>
<p>Finally, it was the day before the exam day. Mum was making a kind of mysterious cake that she didn’t let anyone see her works, while I was busy reviewing my textbooks. In the whole house there was no noise or impatience. The atmosphere in the house was so harmonious that I felt completely relaxed.</p>
<p>The exam day was coming. As soon as I walked out from my bedroom, a kind of special aroma led me to the kitchen door. After a while, Mum walked to the dining room with a plate on her hand. The sweet smell was from here! I couldn’t wait to see what the mysterious thing was. It turned out to be some white cakes.‘They are called Dingsheng Gao,’ Mum said, ‘it means you will be successful after eating these cakes.’</p>
<p>What meaningful cakes! After biting the cake, I found the lovely filling in it-the osmanthus sauce. The fresh taste of the cake gave me a strong feeling: I am going to win with my mother’s love.</p>
<p>Making cakes was Mum’s own way to support me. The unique cakes truly gave me much confidence during the exams. At last, I really got high marks with Mum’s deep love.</p>

        <p>太太你好，我是本次颜间有物市集的访谈记者许馨文~ 因为在我的印象里，绘圈中画的很好的人都可以叫做太太或者老师，请问这样称呼你可以嘛?</p>
<p>因为采访之后，我会整理本次所得的资料，拟出一篇新闻稿，所以会对会议进行录音以便之后回放，谢谢理解！</p>
<p> 借这次艺术市集的机会，我们也是有幸接触了你们这么多艺术家。本次采访的契机是来自新冠疫情这个大背景，我们主要想了解艺术家过往经历、创作习惯、疫情下如何生存等问题，我也针对我自己的采访拟定了一些问题，很想与你聊一聊。</p>
<p>1.首先，我看到你的昵称是“冰山”，就挺戳我的，能不能介绍一下这个名字的由来，以及做一个关于你个人简短的自我介绍呢？（姓名、年龄、来自哪里、现居地、如何走上艺术家这条职业生涯、人生转折点）</p>
<p>2.请问你有成立自己的工作室吗？有：成立缘由、寓意/无：之后有无计划、寓意</p>
<p>3.简单介绍一下作品的风格，有没有一个特别能代表你自己的作品？（之后就某个作品深入聊）</p>
<p>4.我发现，艺术家们会经常用日常的素材摸摸鱼，同时也会大批量的创作和印刷自己的一些作品。那么你认为个人插画作品与商业插画的区别是什么？</p>
<p>5.我从你的朋友圈动态了解到，你的一些作品的素材都来源于电影或者书籍。当你从电影和书籍中收集素材时，有没有感触很深的电影情节或者书中的片段？能不能简单描述一下？</p>
<p>6.新冠疫情让大家被迫足不出户，在此期间，你的艺术创作受到了哪些影响？你的生活状态或习惯有被疫情改变吗？疫情有给你什么创作灵感吗？</p>
<p>7.你平常会通过哪些方式来寻找灵感或提高审美？因为疫情的缘故，行动受限，如果你只能待在家里进行艺术创作，你会通过什么方式来提升自己的审美？</p>
<p>\8. 如果你被隔离十四天，只能使用三样东西来创作，你会选择什么？为什么？</p>
<p>9.我了解到，你现在是正在就读研究生对吗？你未来的职业规划是什么？由于疫情，你会对原先的规划做出调整吗？在这种形式下，你觉得未来艺术家的就业方向会是怎样的？</p>
<p>10.在许多人的印象中，艺术家大多是“神秘的”，请问你同意这个描述吗？为什么？如果要用3个词描述“艺术家”，你会用哪3个词？为什么？</p>
<p>11.采访的最后，我想问一个有意思的问题: 如果2020能够重来一遍，你希望改变什么？</p>
<p>好啦，以上就是本次采访我想要了解的所有问题。非常感谢你能抽出时间来接受我的采访。通过这次机会，我也是对艺术家有了更深刻的认识。总之，非常感谢！</p>

        <p><strong>Young artist’s growth before &amp; during &amp; after the COVID-19 outbreak</strong></p>
<p>  “I’ve experienced challenges in late 2019 and 2020,” said Bing Shan, a young female artist who is currently a postgraduate studying graphic design in Nanjing University of the Arts. “But they truly helped me grow in many ways.”</p>
<p>  Bing Shan’s style of graphic design was undefined in the past. “Most people in my major follow the trend of using abstract and geometric designing method like creating models, but what I’m good at is drawing illustrations.” She asked her tutor about whether she should continue using illustrations to design, or simply follow the mainstream. “She said since I have such a personal style, I should stick to it. So that’s when my direction of graphic design formed.” To her, communication with peers is also very necessary. “ I used to find myself lack of inspiration. However, during a workshop I attended last year, I made friends with some excellent artists who shared the method of ‘create one work a day’, which is carrying a notebook with me to paint the ordinary things happening in daily life. I’ve been keeping this habit since then and it really offers me a lot more materials.”</p>
<p>  In the December of 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak broke out. By that time, Bing Shan was working at her graduation design for undergraduate. The epidemic forced her to use limited sources for graduation design. She searched on the Internet for up-to-date information and other artists’ works to continue her designing. “During that period, my output of paintings was large, which helped me decide the subject of my graduation design as well as posting them on social platforms and making physical products.” </p>
<p>  Her graduation design turned out to be in the context of a philosophy called “Hierarchical theory of needs”, which illustrates the ascending 5 needs of human beings. “The content of my graduation design made me think of my ultimate life-long persuit. After graduation, I ‘d like to continue drawing illustrations. On the other hand, I will use my professional knowledge and ability of graphic design to take over projects to maintain daily life.” She has joined a printing studio , Riso, in the November of 2020, and she is going to work there as a partner after graduation.</p>
<p>   “My expectation is to feed one skill (drawing illustrations) with another skill (making graphic designs),” said Bing Shan. “And that’s what my experience during COVID-19 outbreak has told me.”</p>

        <p>My name is Xu Xinwen. I graduate from Nanjing Jinling High School A-level Centre.</p>
<p> I am a girl who is sensitive about others’ feelings and understands people’s emotions well. As a result, it is relatively easy for me to integrate into a new community and interact with strangers. Moreover, I believe that I own a good sense of determination, which can be reflected in my daily routine. I accomplish my assignments according to my priority so that I make sure that my energy is used efficiently. These aspects make me an organized and gentle person.</p>
<p> My friends sometimes describe me as a ‘workaholic’, because I often work as the team leader in varies of groups. I am used to creating a specific plan and share it with my team members. Furthermore, team members are asked to report their work progresses by me once in a while. In addition, my parents comment me as a ‘enthusiastic risk-taker’, which means I love to accept challenges because of my passion. I am trying to study the guitar, street dance and music making due to my interests in music.</p>
<p> There are some qualities of mine that I am proud of. For instance, my leadership ability, which I have mentioned previously, can help me organize my teams well and give instructions to them correctly and confidently. Besides, I am satisfied with my strong pressure resistance. I have experienced examinations in junior high that could determine my future development, as well as a range of deadlines fulfilled my whole week’s timetable. However, I rarely complain and complete tasks orderly. This quality is helpful in adjusting my emotions when something important and urgent is coming.</p>
<p> In summary, I am a friendly, passionate and well-organized person that can effectively carry forward my targets.</p>

        <p>Shining under the sun<br>In my memory, military training of students is ‘awful and tiring’, according to the elder students. Before I got on the coach to the military base, my heart was full of nervous and unwillingness. I imagined myself to be a bird trapped in a cage which I couldn’t get out.<br>Everything was difficult on the first day. My mum almost put all my stuffs in the suitcase in order to help me create a convenient atmosphere in the military base. Besides, my dormitory was on the second floor, so it seemed like a impossible mission to carry my suitcase to the dormitory. Luckily, a kind lady, who was the dormitory administrator, helped me move my suitcase.<br>I had never stand under the sun for such a long time before I went to the base. When the instructor asked us to stand in the military position for another 5 minutes, I could feel a lot of sweat running down from my face to my toe. As a result, my clothes was completely wet, and that made me extremely uncomfortable. However, it also benefited me because I had to drink plenty of water every day, so my body received more water than usual.<br>Our company’s task was to use our body to shape different words and logos. It was obvious that this was a task which required team work. To my surprise, we cooperated very smoothly, although we had known each other only for a short time. My instructors in the military base were so friendly that they never shouted at us. They even offered us chance to select our favourite songs to play.<br>Other instructors were not as nice as ours, though. One of the instructors who was in charge of the dormitory management was really strict to us. For example, the instructor’s standard of where our luggage should be put was totally different every day. On the first day, we were asked to put our suitcases under our beds, while two days later we were made to put them at the bottom of the shelf. Sometimes we were confused if the instructor aimed to play tricks on us.<br>Our final show was in the afternoon of the sixth day. Teachers, parents and even television journalists gathered here to watch our performance. Our chance to show the power of youth was coming. When it was our turn to perform, we used our loudest voice to shout out our slogans. ‘The words and logos you created were really amazing and beautiful.’, the headmaster said. That afternoon was so hot that I could feel there was fire burning my skin. What’s worse, I found my arms became red and my lips cracked. However, none of us complained because we were proud of ourselves who were shining under the sun. We insisted on making every step of the performance go well, and it was a big success in the end.<br>Six days of military training were like running water and they  flowed away towards the destination called ‘my memory’. I will remember the unique experience forever, including the burning sun, the friendly instructors, the double beds in our dormitories, the feeling of pain in my throat, the perfume I sprayed on my uniform, and so on.</p>

        <p>在前面的课程中，我们已经成功搭建了我们的blog，并将它放到了github通过域名进行访问，今天我们来学习一下如何用Markdown来写文章。</p>
<p>首先简要介绍一下什么是Markdown：</p>
<p>Markdown 是一种轻量级标记语言，它允许人们使用易读易写的纯文本格式编写文档。</p>
<p>Markdown 语言在 2004 由约翰·格鲁伯（英语：John Gruber）创建。</p>
<p>Markdown 编写的文档可以导出 HTML 、Word、图像、PDF、Epub 等多种格式的文档。</p>
<p>Markdown 编写的文档后缀为 .md, .markdown。</p>
<p>1.Markdown标题</p>
<p>我们使用#号来标记我们的标题,一共有六级标题,分别对应1到6个#号,如下</p>
<p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6</p>
<h1 id="一级标题"><a href="#一级标题" class="headerlink" title="一级标题"></a>一级标题</h1><h2 id="二级标题"><a href="#二级标题" class="headerlink" title="二级标题"></a>二级标题</h2><h3 id="三级标题"><a href="#三级标题" class="headerlink" title="三级标题"></a>三级标题</h3><h4 id="四级标题"><a href="#四级标题" class="headerlink" title="四级标题"></a>四级标题</h4><h5 id="五级标题"><a href="#五级标题" class="headerlink" title="五级标题"></a>五级标题</h5><h6 id="六级标题"><a href="#六级标题" class="headerlink" title="六级标题"></a>六级标题</h6><p>对应显示效果如下</p>
