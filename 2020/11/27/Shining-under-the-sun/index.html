        <p>Shining under the sun<br>In my memory, military training of students is ‘awful and tiring’, according to the elder students. Before I got on the coach to the military base, my heart was full of nervous and unwillingness. I imagined myself to be a bird trapped in a cage which I couldn’t get out.<br>Everything was difficult on the first day. My mum almost put all my stuffs in the suitcase in order to help me create a convenient atmosphere in the military base. Besides, my dormitory was on the second floor, so it seemed like a impossible mission to carry my suitcase to the dormitory. Luckily, a kind lady, who was the dormitory administrator, helped me move my suitcase.<br>I had never stand under the sun for such a long time before I went to the base. When the instructor asked us to stand in the military position for another 5 minutes, I could feel a lot of sweat running down from my face to my toe. As a result, my clothes was completely wet, and that made me extremely uncomfortable. However, it also benefited me because I had to drink plenty of water every day, so my body received more water than usual.<br>Our company’s task was to use our body to shape different words and logos. It was obvious that this was a task which required team work. To my surprise, we cooperated very smoothly, although we had known each other only for a short time. My instructors in the military base were so friendly that they never shouted at us. They even offered us chance to select our favourite songs to play.<br>Other instructors were not as nice as ours, though. One of the instructors who was in charge of the dormitory management was really strict to us. For example, the instructor’s standard of where our luggage should be put was totally different every day. On the first day, we were asked to put our suitcases under our beds, while two days later we were made to put them at the bottom of the shelf. Sometimes we were confused if the instructor aimed to play tricks on us.<br>Our final show was in the afternoon of the sixth day. Teachers, parents and even television journalists gathered here to watch our performance. Our chance to show the power of youth was coming. When it was our turn to perform, we used our loudest voice to shout out our slogans. ‘The words and logos you created were really amazing and beautiful.’, the headmaster said. That afternoon was so hot that I could feel there was fire burning my skin. What’s worse, I found my arms became red and my lips cracked. However, none of us complained because we were proud of ourselves who were shining under the sun. We insisted on making every step of the performance go well, and it was a big success in the end.<br>Six days of military training were like running water and they  flowed away towards the destination called ‘my memory’. I will remember the unique experience forever, including the burning sun, the friendly instructors, the double beds in our dormitories, the feeling of pain in my throat, the perfume I sprayed on my uniform, and so on.</p>
